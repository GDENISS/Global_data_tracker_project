📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns in cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts. Using the Our World in Data dataset, it focuses on countries like Kenya, USA, and India (customizable), producing line charts, bar plots, and an interactive choropleth map. The script is designed for clarity and modularity, making it easy to extend or adapt.
Objectives

🧹 Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data.
📈 Analyze trends over time for cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
🌎 Compare metrics across countries.
📊 Visualize trends with charts and maps.
📝 Summarize findings in a console-based report.


✨ Key Features

Robust Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, converts date formats, and filters relevant data.
In-Depth EDA: Calculates death rates and compares trends across countries.
Rich Visualizations:
Line charts for temporal trends.
Bar charts for country comparisons.
Interactive choropleth map for global case distribution.


Customizable: Easily modify countries or add new metrics.
Automated Outputs: Saves plots as PNGs and maps as HTML.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.8+
Libraries:
pandas: Data manipulation
matplotlib & seaborn: Static visualizations
plotly: Interactive maps


Dataset: Our World in Data COVID-19 CSV
Environment: Terminal, VS Code, or any Python IDE


🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip for installing dependencies
owid-covid-data.csv from Our World in Data
Optional: Git for cloning the repository

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-global-data-tracker.git
cd covid19-global-data-tracker


Install Dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly


Add the Dataset:

Download owid-covid-data.csv from the link above.
Place it in the project root directory.




Note: Do not commit the owid-covid-data.csv file to GitHub, as it’s large. Add it to .gitignore.


📋 Usage

Run the Script:
python covid19_data_tracker.py


Outputs:

Console: Prints data summaries, missing value reports, and key insights.
Files:
total_cases_over_time.png: Line chart of cases.
total_deaths_over_time.png: Line chart of deaths.
total_cases_bar.png: Bar chart of cases by country.
total_vaccinations_over_time.png: Line chart of vaccinations.
choropleth_map.html: Interactive global map.




Customize:

Edit the countries list in covid19_data_tracker.py:countries = ['Kenya', 'United States', 'India', 'Germany']


Adjust plot styles or add new visualizations by modifying the script.


Create a Report:

Copy console insights into a document.
Include PNG images and embed choropleth_map.html in a presentation.




Tip: Open choropleth_map.html in a browser for an interactive experience. Requires an internet connection for Plotly.

📈 Data Source
The project uses the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, a reliable and regularly updated CSV. Key columns:

date: Observation date (e.g., 2020-01-01)
location: Country/region (e.g., Kenya)
total_cases: Cumulative confirmed cases
total_deaths: Cumulative deaths
total_vaccinations: Cumulative vaccinations
iso_code: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code for mapping


📉 Visualizations
The script generates:

Line Charts:
Cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time for selected countries.


Bar Chart:
Total cases by country for the latest date.


Choropleth Map:
Global case distribution (interactive, saved as HTML).



Sample Outputs
Note: Outputs depend on your data and selected countries.

Cases Over Time:

Choropleth Map:Open choropleth_map.html in a browser to explore global case density.



🖼️ View All Visualizations
- `total_cases_over_time.png`: Tracks case growth.
- `total_deaths_over_time.png`: Shows mortality trends.
- `total_cases_bar.png`: Compares latest case counts.
- `total_vaccinations_over_time.png`: Monitors vaccination progress.
- `choropleth_map.html`: Displays global case distribution.



📝 Insights
The script prints key findings, such as:

Case Trends: The United States led in total cases, followed by India, with Kenya showing lower counts.
Death Rates: Death rates varied, with [Country X] having the highest (update after analysis).
Vaccination Rollout: [Country Y] achieved rapid vaccination (customize with data).
Anomalies: Spikes in cases in [Country Z] around [date] (update with findings).
Global Patterns: High case density in [regions] (based on choropleth map).

Update these insights in the script or a report after running the analysis.
